# SortingMethods
## About
Methods for sorting kept in one place for my own convenience.
Includes code in python, a short description, and time complexity.

## To do:
<ul>
    <li>Selection sort</li>
    <li>Bubble sort</li>
    <li>Insertion sort</li>
    <li>Topological sort</li>
    <li>Merge sort</li>
    <li>Quick sort</li>
    <li>Heap sort</li>
    <li>Counting sort</li>
</ul>

## Methods:
### Selection sort
Complexity: O(n) writes and O(n^2) reads
Stability: Not stable
- Brute force
- Best for small arrays or when writes are more expensive than reads
- Needs a minimal of n - 1 swaps
Steps:
1. Find the smallest element, swap it with the first element in the array
2. Find the second smallest element, swap it with the second element in the array
3. Repeat until end of array

### Bubble sort
### Insertion sort
### Topological sort
(Using source removal method)
### Merge sort
### Quick sort
### Heap sort
### Counting sort
